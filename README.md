### What is Metastemism?

Metastem是逃避控制的一切：课堂上的白日梦、打破秩序的叛徒、即使在戒严令下仍在继续发声的喷漆墙壁。它是一种坚持认为事情可能会有所不同的感觉，认为现行的社会秩序没有任何自然或必然性。在一个为管理而优化的世界里，所有不能分类或显示在屏幕上的东西都是Metastem。它是反叛精神，没有它，自由简直是不可想象的。

Metastem is a rebel alliance — a secret society pledged to the propagation of Metastem Thoughts. It is a think tank producing ideas and action, a sphinx posing questions fatal to the superstitions of our age.

Metastem is a banner for anonymous collective action. It is not a membership organization, but a mouthpiece for longings that extend throughout the population at large. Anyone can be Metastemer. — it could be your next-door neighbor or the person sitting beside you on the bus. You and your friends already constitute an affinity group, the organizational model best suited to guerrilla tactics, ready to go into action against all the forces that threaten your freedom.

Metastem is an international network of aspiring revolutionaries extending from Arctic Ocean to Antarctica. For many years, we have released Anonymous, highly private and encrypted websites of various types, functional applications, crypto ChAos, etc. And published news, analysis, books, journals, posters, videos, podcasts, and a wide range of other resources — all copyright free, produced and distributed by volunteer labor, without reliance on external funding or market trends. We also coordinate speaking tours, debates, and various other public events. Though we rarely seek public recognition for our efforts, everything we do is informed by our participation in social movements.

Metastem is a desperate venture. As this society lurches ever closer to annihilation, we are staking everything on the possibility that we could kick open the escape hatch to another future. Rather than competing for social capital or selling ourselves to the highest bidder, we have thrown ourselves completely into the struggle for a better world. We invite you to do the same.

Obviously, gentlemen, if you fear for the morality of your wives, the education of your children, the peace of mind of your investors, the submissiveness of your mistresses and housepets, the safety of your armchairs and privatized prisons and factory farms, the manner in which your whorehouses are licensed and the security of the State… then you are right. But what can you do? You are rotten, and the fire has been lit.
